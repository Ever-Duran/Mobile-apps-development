HOW TO DECLARE A VARIABLE:

*var: uses the value that was assigned to infer what type of variable it is.
var petname = 'Chester';

*You can create a variable by specifying what type of value it has.
String pet = 'Chester';
double weigh = 10;

*final: It creates a value which can't be modified.
final int a = 7;

*const: It creates a constant variable that is evaluated while compiling, not on runtime.
const String lastname = "Pedro";
