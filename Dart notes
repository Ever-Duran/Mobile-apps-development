HOW TO DECLARE A VARIABLE:

*var: uses the value that was assigned to infer what type of variable it is.
var petname = 'Chester';

*You can create a variable by specifying what type of value it has.
String pet = 'Chester';
double weigh = 10;

*final: It creates a value which can't be modified.
final int a = 7;

*const: It creates a constant variable that is evaluated while compiling, not on runtime.
const String lastname = "Pedro";


//****************
Functions - void if it doesn't return anything

import 'dart:math';

void greet() {
  print("Your BMI");
}

double bmi (double weigh, double height)  {
  return weigh  / pow(height, 2);
}

void main() {
  greet();
  print(bmi(180, 1.69));
}
//we imported dart:math so we can use pow for the height, otherwise
the code would be return weigh / (height * height)
